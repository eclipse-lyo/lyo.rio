# Contributing to Eclipse Lyo

This guide is to help you get started contributing to the Eclipse Lyo
project.

## Getting started

In order to get your commit merged into master, you need to follow a few steps.

**Before working on your code**

* Register a [new Eclipse account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/)
* File a new bug on Github Issues **before working on your contribution** if you could not find an existing (also closed) bug in Github or [Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi?format=specific).
* If you want to discuss your idea before (and after) filing a bug, join the [lyo-dev mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/lyo-dev).
* Accept and sign the [ECA](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php). Instructions on how to sign are on the right side of the page. **YES, you need to sign an Eclipse agreement before submitting pull requests!**

**Submitting a change**

* Fork this repository.
* Clone your fork and make changes on a new branch.
* Make sure to [include Singed-off-by](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13457203/how-to-add-the-signed-off-by-field-in-the-git-patch) line in your commit message (by doing this, you are signing off on a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/DCO.php)). **Commits without a Singed-off-by line are not accepted!**
* Submit a pull request and assign @jamsden and @berezovskyi to review it.
